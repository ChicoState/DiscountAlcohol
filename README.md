# DiscountAlcohol

This application is designed for people to find alcohol, within a price range and distance from them, and guide them to a store location matching their needs.

Currently we have stores located in Chico. This is perfect for your average party go'er that needs to find the quicket route to the nearest alchohol store.

Whether you need beer, wine, gine, whiskey, etc this app will get you the alcohol you need!

*This is not a installation guide for flutter. I am only describing the app and its functionality*
